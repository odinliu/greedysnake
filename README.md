# Welcome to Greedy Snake

I was reading a book called _Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning Through 2D Game Development and Play_.
So I deviced to make a Greedy Snake game with what I learnt. It's my first game development project,
and also my first rust project.

**How to play**

```shell
$ cargo run
```

Have fun!
